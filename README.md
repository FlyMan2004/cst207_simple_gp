# Current Problems
- After each transaction, ask if the user wants to borrow more books or exit to the main panel, Display a return due date and prompt users to return books on time. => *Done*
- Search for books by title (using Binary Search).  => *Almost done*
- Linear search(search by user name) => *Algorithm is implemented*
- View transaction receipts sorted by receipt number (using Selection Sort).
- Magic number, consider replacing it with a named constant
- Still need more tests (Including input error).
