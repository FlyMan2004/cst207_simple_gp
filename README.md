# Current Problems
- After all borrowing transactions, display only one receipt(including a unique random receipt number, the customerâ€™s name, return due date, and details of the borrowed books, sorted by book ID(using Quick Sort))
- (admin panel) display transaction receipts sorted by receipt number (using Selection Sort).
- a borrowed book can not be edited.
- Still need more tests (Including input error).
